# MBTA redline map

<!--Currently, the map successfully shows the Redline with a polyline and is centered on South Station. The map is currently missing markers for each station. -->

<!--[Update: 07/27/16-10:45pm] Added markers for each station. However, the for loop uses static parameter. Should be changed later if time permits. -->

[Update: 08/03/16-11:50PM] Currently, the map successfully shows the user's location with a marker and shows the Redline with a polyline. Each station is shown with a custom marker. The map is currently unable to display a polyline from the user to the nearest station. 

Still working on displaying the wait times correctly.

This assignment was completed alone and has currently taken a total of 5 hours.
