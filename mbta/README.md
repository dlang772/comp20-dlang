# MBTA redline map

Currently, the map successfully shows the Redline with a polyline and is centered on South Station. The map is currently missing markers for each station. 

[Update: 07/27/16-10:45pm] Added markers for each station. However, the for loop uses static parameter. Should be changed later if time permits. 

This assignment was completed alone and has currently taken a total of 4 hours.
