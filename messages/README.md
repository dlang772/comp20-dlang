# Messages Part 2

All aspects of the assignment have been successfully implemented. The webpage will display the messages from the parse data. The only difference is using the xmlhttprequest to get the data.

This assignment was completed alone and took a total of 2 hours.


Q&A:

It is not possible to request data from a different origin or from the local machine because javascript is limited by a "same origin policy" that prevents malicious script from contacting a remote server and sending private data.
